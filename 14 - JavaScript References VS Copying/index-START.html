      // start with strings, numbers and booleans
      // let age = 100
      // let age2 = age
      // console.log(age, age2)
      // age = 200
      // console.log(age, age2)
      // let name = 'wes'
      // let name2 = name
      // console.log(name, name2)
      // name = 'wesley'
      // console.log(name, name2)

      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy']

      // and we want to make a copy of it.
      const team = players
      console.log(players, team)
      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      team[3] = 'Lux'
      // however what happens when we update that array?
      console.log(team, players) // the updating of the array references back to the original array!
      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      // one way
      const team2 = players.slice() // makes a new copy
      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const team3 = [].concat(players) // creates a new array and then puts the old array items in
      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const team4 = [...players] // spreads each item into a new array
      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
      const team5 = Array.from(players) // creates a new array from players
      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: 'Wes Bos',
        age: 80,
        likes: {
          sports: ['soccer', 'bball'],
          food: {
            carbs: 'pasta',
            dessert: 'ice cream',
          },
        },
      }

      // and think we make a copy:
      const captain = person
      //captain.number = 10 // this changes the original person object by going back to the reference
      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const cpt2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 12 })
      console.log(person, cpt2)
      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread -- NOW WE DO!
      const cpt3 = { ...person, position: 'middle-back' }
      console.log(cpt3, person)
      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
      console.clear()
      console.log(person)
      const steve = { ...person, name: 'steve' }
      console.log(person, steve)
      steve.likes.food.dessert = 'cake'
      console.log(person, steve) // now both like cake mwahahaha
